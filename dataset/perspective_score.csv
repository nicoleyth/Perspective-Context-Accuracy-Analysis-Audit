","Very interesting.  If ""J"" really is the accepted symbol for the dimensions of luminous flux/intensity, then the table is correct.  However ""J"" seems a very bizarre symbol to pick for this purpose, so I wonder whether this is correct for English or is perhaps a mis-borrowing from another language?  The symbol doesn't seem obvious or well-known enough to use in this table without explanation. I have replaced ""J"" with ""Iv"" in the table, as a quick fix to the problem. Alternate possible solutions include defining the symbol in a footnote, or deleting the whole ""dimension"" column altogether, as it doesn't add a lot of value to the table since units are already listed.
